Key points:
  - cookies are supported in older and newer browsers wheres as local and session are not
  - biggest difference between localStorage/sessionStorage and cookies is that you are able to store cookies in the browser and server and you can send cookies with requests -- not able to do with localStorage/sessionStorage
  - cookies are sent to the server on every request (loading an image, css, html, js, etc)
  - cookies are best for data that needs to be accessed by server and local machine or when you want to set an expiration date
  - cookies can be used for authentication
